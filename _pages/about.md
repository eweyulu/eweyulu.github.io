I am a final-year Ph.D. researcher in Internet transport protocols with the Internet Architecture group at the [Max-Planck-Institut für Informatik](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/home) in Saarbrücken, Germany, advised by [Prof. Anja Feldmann, Ph.D](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/inet/people/anja-feldmann/). I am also affiliated with the [Saarbrücken Graduate School of Computer Science](https://www.graduateschool-computerscience.de/). My research work focuses on optimizing network transport algorithms for efficient data transmission, reduced latency, and enhanced reliability.

I am currently seeking research opportunities to deepen my expertise in networking technologies, particularly in congestion control and flow control for low-latency, high-throughput applications.
